# Introduction
The overarching goal of this library is to provide open-source software to facilite the processing of both optical and inertial-based motion capture data using the latest methodologies. 

# Present objective
The current objectiv is to provide a repoitory for the following:
* Kinematic data processing (e.g. rotation matrices)
* Sensor fusion development and validation for inertial-based motion capture systems
