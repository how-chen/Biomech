# Introduction
These functions are used to calculate inclination measurements (pitch and roll) angles. The output for all functions is in quaternions to remove ambiguity. For these functions, the first element of the quaternion vector is the 'real' or 'scalar' component. It is not uncommon for the real component to be define as the last component of the quaternion rotation vector.
